            <h1>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h1>
            <p>
              The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500
              companies has allowed me to have a developer skillset that helps
              me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's
              largest communites teaching young minds about how to sell yourself
              as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunies.

              As a developer, you have everything available to you and all
              that's holding you back is yourself.

              "How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn't fail?" You've
              already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's
              time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something
              you're passionate about.
            </p>
